# Hello World Examples

The only requirement for the example web app that you use is that it returns _something_ to be displayed in a user's web browser. One page/view with "Hello World" on it is perfectly adequate - this is just a placeholder. We don't want you to have to take the time to write a sample web app yourself.

Here is a list of "Hello World"-style example applications that we've found in various languages and frameworks. Feel free to use one of these, or find (or write, if you really want, though we wouldn't recommend it) one of your own. We haven't tried all of these, nor are they representative of the languages we use, so please keep that in mind.
